Straight forward, the best piece of hardware I laid my hands on in the past decade was this lovely piece:

It's the SteelSeries Sensei. No I don't get money from them for saying this. I wish I would, nothing wrong with that, if what I say is really how I feel. The mouse is enough though. Enough *payment* to praise it. Let's talk about why:

## Palm held
I hold my mouse in an oblique arch of pinky and thumb. Kind of a clench of the thumbs and pinkies MCP (metacarpo phalangeal joint). Okay okay, I had to google it:

The Sensei is really well designed to do exactly that. For comparison, try to hold Apples mighty mouse the same way and you end up with cramps and sore skin from the sharp plastic edges.

## Smooth, glossy surface
Kind of subjective, but I really like glossy materials on mouses. Yes you have to clean it more often, but hey... It is then cleaned more often.

## Mid/Mid sensor position
Repositioning of the mouse is constantly required, the larger the screen the more repositioning necessary. I don't know about you, but for me there is a certain movement, a lift of the palm, perfectly integrated into all mouse movements. Its angle, height and duration often similar, the movement developed over years of mouse usage. I had all kinds of sensor positions on my devices, and everything that wasn't perfectly centered below my palm drove me mad in very little time. You don't want that cursor to move if you're doing a repositioning move. It's also super annoying, if the sensor starts picking up movement a moment to soon and the downward motion while setting the mouse back down creates cursor movement. First time I saw this, but the Sensei allows you to adjust lift-height and the sensor won't pick up anything before the defined height is reached. So convenient!

## 4 shoulder/side buttons
Almost too many, but only almost. Purists would go for a shoulder-button-less mouse and I am tempted for that as well, but keep using the sparsly distributed shoulder buttons too much as to argue I wish they weren't there.
