Hi, I'm [Alex](https://github.com/atripes).
I was 6 when I first laid hands on a mouse fumbling around in MS paint (on Windows 3.1). Since then I am fascinated with computers. I can fascinate myself for a lot of things, and I love learning something new and becoming mediocre in it. I am restless, but only in mind.

I like to use vim for every task it is suited for. This is true for all other pieces of software I use.
